# Deep Learning from scratch

Book reading log "Deep Learning from scratch" (Ja『ゼロから作る Deep Learning』)

## Summary

### Chapter 1: Introduction to Python

* Basic Python3 syntax
* How to use following libraries
    * numpy
    * matplotlib


### Chapter 2: Perceptron

* Perceptron is algorithm that has input and outputs. when input passes then return specific value
* Perceptron has parameters weight and bias
* Using perceptron, we can implement logical circuit(such as AND/OR gate)
* XOR gate can implement more than two layer perceptron
* single layer perceptron can express only liner area, but multi-layer perceptron can express non-liner area.
* multi-layer perceptron can express computer(logically)


### Chapter 3: Neural Network
